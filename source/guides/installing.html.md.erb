intro: >
  Learn how to install Crystal, Lucky, and the required dependencies. Lucky
  works on macOS and Linux machines. A few dependencies are required before
  getting started.
---

## Install Required Dependencies

To get Lucky, you need to install these first.

* Heroku CLI (later Lucky will support foreman, and forego as well)
* Node
* Yarn
* Crystal
* Postgres

## Install Lucky

Once the required dependencies are installed, set up Lucky for your system.

### On macOS

* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Run `brew tap luckyframework/homebrew-lucky`
* Run `brew install lucky`
* If you are on macOS High Sierra you may need to add `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig`
to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`

### On Linux machines

* `git clone` the CLI repo at https://github.com/luckyframework/cli
* cd into the newly cloned directory
* Run `crystal deps`
* Run `crystal build src/lucky.cr --release --no-debug`
* Move the generated `lucky` binary to your path. Most of the time you can move
  it to `/usr/local/bin` and it should work.

## Start a New Project

To start a new project, run `lucky init {project_name}`.

So if you wanted to start a new app for your blog you might do:

```
lucky init my_blog
```

## Running a Lucky Project

To start the server and run your project, first change into the directory for your
newly created app with `cd {project_name}`. Then run `lucky dev`.

Running `lucky dev` will use the Heroku CLI to start the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`.
By default `Procfile.dev` will start the lucky server, and will start Brunch to compile assets.
